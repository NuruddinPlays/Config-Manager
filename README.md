# Config Manager

**Config Manager** is a Minecraft mod that allows modpack developers to ship configuration files in a simple and user-friendly way.  
It supports both **NeoForge** and **Fabric**, starting from **Minecraft 1.20.1** and newer.

## Features

### Ship modpack defaults without overriding user preferences
- Place your modpack’s default configuration files in `/config/modpack_default`.
- At startup, all files from that directory are copied into the Minecraft directory **only if they do not already exist**.

**Examples:**
- `.minecraft/config/modpack_default/options.txt` → copied to `.minecraft/options.txt`
- `.minecraft/config/modpack_default/config/myMod.json` → copied to `.minecraft/config/myMod.json`

This ensures that user settings are preserved across modpack updates.

### Update or reset to the modpack’s defaults
From the mod list (NeoForge) or Mod Menu (Fabric), you can open the Config Manager GUI and choose between two actions:

1. **Update** – Copies (overwriting) the modpack’s config files on top of the user’s.
    - All settings changed by the pack are updated.
    - Untouched settings remain as configured by the user.

2. **Reset** – Wipes the entire `config` directory and replaces it with the files shipped by the modpack.
    - Useful to fix broken or corrupted installations.
